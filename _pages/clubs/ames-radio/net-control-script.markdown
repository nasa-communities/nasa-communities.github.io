*SVECS net is every Tuesday at 8 pm (2000 hrs) on the AA6BT repeater on 146.115+, PL 100.0. Net control will make announcements for meetings and various officials to check in, then will ask for each city to report their number of check-ins. NASA Ames is considered a city as part of ARES/RACES for Santa Clara County. SVECS website is at [https://www.svecs.net](https://www.svecs.net)*

*When net control operator announces, "We will now poll the cities for a count of their check-ins" and then will later ask, "Number of check-ins for NASA Ames?" At this point, you will announce,*

"NASA Ames had _____ check-ins today. This is [your call sign]."

*Congratulations… You have just performed the net control task!*
