## What is Toastmasters International?

<a name="what"></a>**1. What is Toastmasters?**

Toastmasters International is a non-profit educational 
corporation headquartered in Rancho Santa Margarita, California.   
Its mission is to improve communication and leadership 
skills of its members and in general.  Mainly, this works out 
to 'improving public speaking skills' but there is also a 
potent leadership and management aspect to the organization if 
you aspire to reach that level.

<a name="english"></a>**2. Is this just a group for people in the USA or for people who speak English?**

No.  The organization includes approximately 180,000 members 
in 54 countries, including Australia, the Bahamas, Canada, 
Ireland, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, the Philippines, 
Singapore, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.  

Toastmasters International publishes a complete set of materials in English 
and basic materials in French, Spanish, and Japanese.  As translators make 
themselves available, more materials are translated.

<a name="organize"></a>**3.  How is Toastmasters organized?**

All Toastmasters members belong to one or more clubs.  Clubs consist 
of at least eight members and may have forty or more.  The recommended 
size for a club is twenty or more.  

Clubs exist in communities around the world, especially in North America, 
and it's a rare locality in the United States that doesn't 
have at least one Toastmasters club within thirty minutes' 
driving time.  There are, at present, over 8,000 clubs around 
the world, and most of them are in the United States.  

There are many sorts of clubs: community clubs, military clubs, 
company clubs, prison clubs, collegiate clubs, and so on.  
At this time, the majority of the *new* clubs being chartered 
are 'company clubs', i.e. clubs chartered at and meeting at 
businesses and organizations, in many cases open only to 
employees or members of those organizations.  Never fear, 
however; there are thousands of community clubs already in existence as well.

<a name="where"></a>**4.  Where can I find a club?**

If you'd like to visit a club meeting, simply telephone Toastmasters 
International World Headquarters at (714) 858-8255 and ask 
for the locations of the clubs near you.  Alternately, drop a 
postcard to:

TI WHQ, 
P.O. Box 9052
Mission Viejo, CA 92690

and ask for the local clubs' listings.  You may be VERY surprised 
by how many clubs there are in your area. Quite a few clubs 
don't get around to advertising in the newspaper.  

Complete listings for all clubs in the world can be found at 
https://www.toastmasters.org/index.html

If you cannot access the World Wide Web, send email to tminfo@toastmasters.org 
and ask; be sure to include your postal address so the 
information can be mailed to you.

<a name="visit"></a>**5. Do I have to ask permission before attending a meeting of a club in my area?**

Usually no.  

If you're visiting a community club, it might not be a bad idea to 
let them know you're coming so they can tell you any details 
like what time members arrive to eat and what time members who 
don't come to eat arrive, but community clubs are almost always 
open to all and they'll be delighted to have you come to the meeting.

Clubs that meet at companies and organizations, on military bases, 
or in prisons are often, but not always, restricted to members 
or employees of the sponsoring body.  These clubs are happy 
to have guests but you sometimes need to call ahead to get 
through security or to find out specifically where the club meets.

Unlike some other organizations, where one must have a 
sponsoring member who _invites_ you to the meeting and  
introduces you to the group, Toastmasters welcomes all guests.  
If the club is open to membership from the community, you will 
usually be offered a membership application at the end of the 
meeting.

<a name="social"></a>**6. Is Toastmasters a social or drinking organization in some regard?**

The name "Toastmasters" is a holdover from the founding of the 
organization, when one of the main types of public speaking a 
member of society would engage in was after-dinner speaking, 
a.k.a. toastmastering.  It is rare that formal drinking and 
toasts take place, and these are usually at major banquets or 
conferences. 

In general, though, you'll find two types of clubs: those that 
have a meal with their meetings and those that don't.  Clubs 
that have a meal with their meeting may charge their members 
for the meals in advance and pay the restaurant in one lump 
sum or may have members order off the menu.  Since breakfast 
and lunch clubs are popular with the business community, you 
can often kill two birds with one stone by joining Toastmas- 
ters: educating yourself and having a meal with business 
associates.  You'll also find some clubs that get meeting 
space by having dinner before their meetings -- and half the 
members wait until dinner is over to arrive.  There's infinite 
variety to it all.  This is one good reason to call in 
advance. 

Many clubs do *not* have meals with their meetings, though.  
Quite a few clubs meet after dinnertime in a public meeting 
room at a bank or library or at a church, have their meeting, 
and go home.  

<a name="meeting"></a>**7. What happens at a meeting?**

The format varies slightly from club to club, but the basics 
include:  

- the business meeting (usually very brief)
- introduction of the Toastmaster of the Meeting, who presides 
over the program that day and explains the meeting as it goes along
- prepared speeches from members (of which more below)
- impromptu speeches from members (also known as Table Topics, of which more below)
- oral evaluations of the prepared speeches (of which more below)
- reports from other evaluation personnel, such as speech timer, 
grammarian, "ah" counter, wordmaster, and General Evaluator.

Meetings last anywhere from one hour (especially at lunch or 
breakfast) to three hours (if the club meets infrequently or 
has long-winded speakers). 

<a name="prepared"></a>**8. What's a "prepared speech?"**

When you join Toastmasters (see the "Membership" FAQ) you 
receive a basic speaking manual with ten speech projects.  
Each project calls on you to prepare a speech on a subject of 
your own choosing but using certain speaking principles.  Each 
manual project lists the objectives for that speech and 
includes a written checklist for your evaluator to use when 
evaluating the speech.  Thus, if you're scheduled to speak at 
a meeting, you generally pull out your manual a week or two in 
advance and put together a speech on whatever you like but 
paying attention to your goals and objectives for that speech.  
Then, when you go to the meeting, you hand your manual to your 
evaluator and that person makes written comments on the 
checklist while you speak.  At the end of the meeting, that 
person (your evaluator) will rise to give oral commentary as 
well.  The purpose of the extensive preparation and commentary 
is to show you what you're doing well, what you need to work 
on, and driving these lessons home so you're constantly 
improving. 

<a name="projects"></a>**9. What speech projects are there for me to work on?**

In the basic ("Communication and Leadership" manual), there are ten speech projects:

1. Icebreaker - 4 to 6 minutes - getting over nervousness by introducing yourself to the club.
2. Be In Earnest - 5 to 7 minutes - continue to get over nervousness by speaking about 
something you believe deeply in.
3. Organize Your Speech - 5 to 7 minutes - work on giving a well-organized speech.
4. Show What You Mean - 5 to 7 minutes - not a "Show and Tell" speech, this project 
calls on you to work with gestures and body language during your speech.  Unfortunately, 
many members somehow confuse the issue and show up with 
a bag full of props that they use in a "Show and Tell" 
style speech.  Don't do that. 
5. Vocal Variety - 5 to 7 minutes - work on rate of delivery,
volume, speed, pitch, emphasis, etc. 
6. Work with Words - 5 to 7 minutes - work on proper word
choice, avoiding jargon and generalizations, etc. 
7. Apply Your Skills - 5 to 7 minutes - go back and practice 
everything you've learned up to this point.
8. Be Persuasive - 6 to 8 minutes - give a persuasive speech 
on a controversial issue.
9. Speak With Knowledge - 7 minutes, plus or minus 30 seconds 
- research an issue, write a speech, and then *read* that 
speech to the audience (as opposed to using notecards or 
notes or whatever you used for the previous eight 
speeches)... and have it well-rehearsed, so it doesn't 
run long or end too soon.
10. Inspire Your Audience - 8 to 10 minutes - The final speech 
in the manual calls on you to move and inspire your 
audience in a well-presented and well-prepared speech.

As you can see, all ten projects above are wide-open for you 
to choose whatever topic you like.  Even if you pick a 
controversial subject, most Toastmasters audiences will 
evaluate you on how well you presented your subject, not on 
whether they agreed with you or not. 

For further information about the speaking program, see the 
"Educational Advancement FAQ." 

<a name="table"></a>**10. What is "Table Topics?"**

Table Topics is fun!  It's also terrifying.  Basically, it 
calls on you, the guest or member, to present a one to two 
minute impromptu speech on a subject not known to you until 
the moment you get up to speak!  A member of the club assigned 
to be Topicsmaster will prepare a few impromptu topics and 
call on members (or guests, if they've given assent in advance 
to being called on) to stand up and speak on the topic.  
Topics might include current events (e.g. "What would you do 
about Haitian boat people if you were President?") or philoso- 
phy ("If you had no shoes and met a man who had no feet, how 
would you feel?") or the wacky ("Reach into this bag.  Pull an 
item out.  Tell us about it."). 

<a name="evaluate"></a>**11. What is Evaluation?**

The Evaluation program is the third of the three main parts to 
the meeting.  All prepared speakers, as noted above, should 
have their speaking manuals with them and should have passed 
them on to the evaluators beforehand.  During the speech, and 
after, each person's evaluator should make written notes and 
furthermore, plan what to say during the two to three minute 
oral evaluation.  Evaluation is tough to do well because it 
requires an evaluator to do more than say "here's what you did 
wrong."  A good evaluator will say "here's what you did 
*well*, and here's why doing that was good, and here are some 
things you might want to work on for your next speech, and 
here's how you might work on them."  It's important to 
remember that the evaluator is just one point of view, 
although one that has focused in on your speech closely.  
Other members of the audience can and should give you written 
or spoken comments on aspects of your speech they feel 
important. 

<a name="time"></a>**12.  What's all this emphasis on time limits?**

As noted above, speeches have time limits, Table Topics have 
time limits (1-2 minutes, usually) and evaluations have time 
limits (2-3 minutes, usually).  This is in order to drive home 
the point that a good speaker makes effective use of the time 
allotted and does not keep going and going and going until the 
audience is bored.  In the real world, quite often there are 
practical limits on how long a meeting can or should go; by 
setting time limits on speeches and presentations, partici- 
pants learn brevity and time management and the club meeting 
itself can be expected to end on schedule. 

Time limits are rarely enforced to the letter.  In only a few 
situations will you find yourself cut off if you go too long, 
and that's up to the individual club.  Most clubs don't cut 
speakers off if they go overtime.   

It is common for clubs to use a set of timing lights to warn 
the speakers of the advance of time.  All speeches and 
presentations have a time limit expressed as an interval, e.g. 
5 to 7 minutes.  A green light would be shown at 5 minutes, 
amber at 6, and red at 7.  In Table Topics, the lights would 
go 1, 1.5, and 2 minutes respectively.  When the green light 
comes on, you've at least spoken enough, though you need not 
finish right away, and when the yellow light comes on, you 
should begin wrapping up.  If you're not done by the time the 
red light comes on, you should finish as soon as possible 
without mangling the ending of your speech. 

The only times you're actually *penalized* for going over or 
under time is in speaking competition; in speech contests (see 
the "Contests FAQ") you must remain within the interval or be 
disqualified.   

Some clubs hold an audience vote for "best speaker," "best 
topic speaker," and "best evaluator" during the meeting and 
it's a practice in some clubs to disqualify people who go over 
or under time from these meeting awards.  Check with the 
particular club to see what they do. 

<a name="structure"></a>**13. Why all this structure to the meeting?**

If meetings sound complicated, we're sorry.  Meetings general- 
ly are not complicated once you get used to the timing lights 
in the back and the different roles members of the group play.  
Since the average club is expected to have 20 or more members, 
you need a lot of roles for people to play in order to involve 
everyone.  And, since meeting assignments vary from meeting to 
meeting, everyone gets practice doing everything over the 
course of several meetings.  One meeting, you'll be assigned 
to give a speech; the next, you might be timer; the next, you 
might be the Toastmaster of the Meeting, running the whole 
show.  It keeps you flexible and it keeps you from having to 
prepare a speech EVERY meeting, which would get old quickly. 

<a name="scared"></a>**14. I'm scared to death of speaking!  Why should I look into Toastmasters?**

**EVERYONE** is afraid of speaking.  In poll after poll, "public 
speaking" comes up as more feared than "death."  Public 
speaking is the nation's #1 fear.  You are no different.  Even 
if you think you're really good at speaking, there will come 
times when your heart stops and your palms sweat and you 
freeze before an audience.  Toastmasters can help with that. 

Remember that EVERYONE in a Toastmasters club is there because 
at some point they realized they needed help communicating and 
speaking before audiences.  Almost everyone will remember how 
wretched they felt when they gave their first speech.  You may 
be startled to find out how supportive a Toastmasters club 
really can be.  [The author of this FAQ recruited a friend to 
Toastmasters who was so overwrought and nervous that she 
sobbed as if her heart was broken after her first speech.  
Ditto for the second.  Some tears after the third.  Eventually 
she realized that we weren't going to eat her alive and she 
came to enjoy it.  By the time she earned her CTM, she 
consistently won "best speaker" votes at our meetings.] 

If you're aware how nervous you are but aren't convinced that 
you should do anything about it, stop and think what skill is 
more important than any other when it comes to getting and 
keeping a good job? 

Think you're already an excellent speaker?  People who think 
they're really good sometimes come into Toastmasters and find 
out how unstructured and sloppy they really are.  Being 
comfortable doesn't mean that you're actually GOOD.  Even if 
you ARE good, you can always get better.  Toastmasters can 
give you a lot of skills and keep good speakers improving. 

If you still don't know whether you'd like Toastmasters, why 
not visit a meeting?  If you still don't think it's your cup 
of tea, we'll still be happy you came by. 

<a name="benificial"></a>**15. How is Toastmasters more beneficial than other forms of speaking improvement?**

College and high school courses in public speaking usually 
involve the students sitting through dozens of lectures 
followed by one or two speaking opportunities.  When the 
speeches are over, you get a grade.  Often, you get graded on 
what you did wrong.  This isn't a way to build reassurance and 
motivation.  Then too, you rarely get much of a chance to 
practice by doing.  You get up at the end of the semester, 
give your speech, and sit down.  Toastmasters is constant 
reinforcement and constant improvement.  You learn by doing, 
not by sitting there while someone lectures for hours. 

For-profit courses such as Dale Carnegie can be very good for 
their participants.  They also cost a lot and when they're 
over, they're over.  Toastmasters costs $36 per year (plus 
club dues, if any) and it can last a lifetime. 

<a name="moreinfo"></a>**16. Where should I go for further information?**

## Membership in Toastmasters International

<a name="join"></a>**1. How does one go about joining Toastmasters?**

First, of course, you must have found a club to join.  If you 
have visited a club and found it to your liking, ask a member 
(preferably an officer, who is more likely to be able to help 
you) for an application form.   

According to the bylaws all Toastmasters clubs operate under, 
any new member of a club must be voted into membership by the 
club.  In practice, this rarely happens.  Instead, members are 
welcomed enthusiastically into the club as soon as a standard 
membership application ("Form 400") is turned in with a check 
for the appropriate dues. 

<a name="cost"></a>**2. How much does membership cost?**

Upon joining Toastmasters, you will find yourself paying three  
different fees.  One is the standard $16.00 fee that every new 
member must pay in order to receive educational materials (see 
below).  One is the standard International dues, $3.00 per 
month.  One is your Club dues, if any. 

All Toastmasters clubs are billed in March and September for 
semi-annual dues for their members who wish to remain members 
for the next six months.  If you join in between those 
periods, you submit a _pro-rated_ share of the dues. 

Clubs usually charge dues on top of the world dues.  This is 
so they'll have money in the treasury for expenses.  It's up 
to each club what they want to charge.  Some clubs waive the 
club dues for new members and only assess them at the semi- 
annual dues payment dates. 

So, to make a long story short, if you join at the following 
times, you'd owe: 

April or October:     $16.00  +  $18.00   +  club dues

May or November:      $16.00  +  $15.00   +  club dues

June or December      $16.00  +  $12.00   +  club dues

July or January       $16.00  +   $9.00   +  club dues

August or February    $16.00  +   $6.00   +  club dues

September or March    $16.00  +   $3.00   +  club dues

Then, once you're signed up, dues of $18.00 are assessed every 
six months, in September and March. 

*Note: due to California law, members of _California_ clubs pay 
sales tax on their new member fee.*

<a name="morethanone"></a>**3. Can I belong to more than one club?**

Yes.  This is called "dual membership" even if you belong to more 
than two clubs.  When you join the second club, of course, you don't 
need to pay the New Member fee because you don't need a second set of 
starter materials (see below). 

<a name="duesforeach"></a>**4.  If I belong to more than one club, do I have to pay full dues for each?**

Yes.  If you belong to more than one club, you must nonetheless pay full 
dues for each club.  

<a name="tax"></a>**5. Are my dues tax deductible?**

In the United States, they are -- IF your job is of a sort 
that requires or necessitates good communications skills.  In 
other words, it must be an educational expense to be tax 
deductible.  Toastmasters International will send you complete 
tax deduction explanations if you request them to do so. 

<a name="get"></a>**6. What do I get for my dues?**

Your $18.00 semi-annual dues paid to World Headquarters goes 
partly for a subscription to the _Toastmaster_ magazine 
(which, to be honest, is an excellent magazine), partly to 
support development of new educational programs (they've got 
some *nice* new programs coming out these days), partly to 
support operations at World Headquarters (i.e. the staff who 
process membership applications, CTM applications, new club 
applications, etc. etc. ad nauseam), and partly to support 
your local District organization.   

Furthermore, when you finish your CTM, you get three of the 
Advanced project manuals for no extra charge to work toward 
your ATM with. 

Dues went up for the first time in over ten years last year 
and as a result, dues should not rise for a long time (it was 
like pulling teeth to get the most recent dues raise through, 
and some members remain unconvinced that it was necessary).  
This raise had a lot to do with printing costs and so forth 
quintupling over the last decade. 

Your club dues generally go to pay for the club's supplies, 
such as ballots, awards, ribbons, and educational materials.  
In some cases, such as when your club has a meal at each 
meeting, your dues may go to pay for that. 

<a name="newfee"></a>**7. What do I get for my New Member fee?**

Your $16.00 New Member fee gets you the following:

- the Communication and Leadership project manual
- the "Gestures - Your Body Speaks" manual
- the "A Speaker's Guide to Evaluation" manual
- the Voice manual

The latter three are instructional manuals rather than project 
manuals.  Only the first is a workbook. 

<a name="dropout"></a>**8.  If I want to drop out of Toastmasters after joining, what do I do?**

Simply wait for March or September to arrive and don't pay
your dues again.

It'd probably be a good idea to let your Vice President  
Education know to stop scheduling you for speeches, though. 

<a name="receptive"></a>**9.  How receptive are clubs to new members?**

Since most people are genuinely terrified of public speaking, 
Toastmasters has its hands full recruiting members.  There's 
virtually no chance that you won't be enthusiastically 
welcomed into any club you join and immediately be considered 
one of the gang. 

Occasionally, however, people get into bad situations, but the 
same is true of ANY organization.  There are jerks everywhere.  
Toastmasters probably has its share.  For this reason, the 
author of this FAQ considers it a good idea to visit ALL 
Toastmasters clubs in your area before deciding which one you 
want to join. 

If a club that you visit turns out to be full of jerks, please 
don't assume that this is true of the entire organization.   
Once in a while, people come to forget that they're part of a 
larger organization and act as though the message and mission 
of Toastmasters doesn't concern them.  Please nod, leave, and 
visit some other club.  This is definitely the exception, but 
we cannot honestly say that it never happens. 

<a name="whenspeak"></a>**10.  If I join, will they make me speak right away?**

No.  You will not be asked to speak unless you're ready to.  
If you feel more comfortable waiting a few months, that's fine. 
Most clubs attempt to arrange the meeting schedules in such 
a way that most members are involved in some capacity at each 
meeting, so you'll need to let them know what your wishes are.

## Educational Advancement in Toastmasters International

<a name="objective"></a>**1. What should my main objective be as a new Toastmasters member?**

Well, there are two "right" answers to this question.  The first is that 
your main objective should be to attend every meeting you can and 
participate to the fullest, helping yourself and the other members of 
the club to become better communicators.  The other "right" answer is 
that you should be working toward the CTM award. 

<a name="CTM"></a>**2. What does CTM stand for?**

It stands for "Competent Toastmaster."  The CTM is the basic speaking 
certification offered through Toastmasters.  Many members join, earn 
their CTM, and drop out of the organization.  It's the basic "diploma." 

<a name="doforctm"></a>**3. What do I have to do to earn a CTM?**

You have to complete the Communication and Leadership (C&L) manual, 
which in effect means you have go work your way through the ten speech 
projects contained therein.  When you finish your manual, you'll 
complete the registration information in the back of the manual and send 
it in to World Headquarters in California. 

<a name="allattm"></a>**4. Do I have to give all the speeches at Toastmasters club meetings?**

No.  So long as you are giving the speech to an audience with at least 
one Toastmasters member in attendance, and so long as a fellow Toastmas- 
ter completes the manual evaluation for that project, you may count that 
speech toward a CTM.  

<a name="inorder"></a>**5. Do I have to work through the C&L manual in the order the projects are given?**

No.  You can do the projects out of order if you like.  It is 
recommended that you follow the order given since the projects progress 
upwards in difficulty but if you have a speech idea or opportunity that 
better suits one of the later projects you may skip over earlier ones 
and do that one first. 

<a name="finishctm"></a>**6. When I finish the CTM what happens?**

When you finish, there's a form in the back of your manual to fill out, 
sign, and send in to World Headquarters.  When your paperwork is 
received at World Headquarters they enter it into the computer and you 
are issued a CTM certificate.  If you mark it on the registration sheet 
they will also send a letter to your employer letting them know.  Also, 
when you send in the registration sheet you're asked what three advanced 
manuals you'd like copies of, so you can start working on the ATM. 

<a name="ATM"></a>**7. What's the ATM?**

ATM means Able Toastmaster.  It's the next level of Toastmasters 
achievement after the CTM.  If you like, you can consider the CTM the 
"core curriculum" and the ATM your actual "major."  As there are 12 
"specializations" you can work on to get your ATM, this is a fairly 
accurate generalization. 

<a name="doforatm"></a>**8. What do I have to do to get an ATM?**

Well, it's a little more difficult than a CTM, for starters.  You have 
to:  

1. have received a CTM, 
2. completed three of the Advanced manuals, each of which has five speech projects,
3. have served a complete term as an elected club officer (e.g.
President, VP Education, VP Membership, VP Public Relations, Secre- 
tary, Treasurer, or Sergeant at Arms).  A term is one year in clubs 
that meet twice monthly or monthly and six months in clubs that 
meet weekly. 
4. have given three speeches before non-Toastmasters groups

<a name="manuals"></a>**9.  What advanced manuals are available?**

There are fourteen manuals available, each with five speech projects of 
various lengths:  

- The Entertaining Speaker
- Speaking To Inform 
- Public Relations 
- The Discussion Leader 
- Specialty Speeches 
- Speeches By Management 
- The Professional Speaker 
- The Professional Salesperson 
- Technical Presentations 
- Communicating On Television 
- Storytelling 
- Interpretive Reading 
- Special Occasion Speeches 
- Interpersonal Communication 

You receive three of these for no cost when you complete your CTM.  
Additional manuals cost $2.25 plus postage and handling. 

<a name="edops"></a>**10. Other than the CTM and ATM, what educational opportunities are there in 
Toastmasters?**

Well, there's the DTM, of which more in a moment, but there are also 
Success/Leadership modules.  If you'd like to delve in detail into 
subjects such as management, the qualities of a leader, effective 
listening, parliamentary procedure, creative thinking, and so forth, 
Toastmasters International offers pre-packaged course materials for you 
or a member of your club to present to a group of participants.  These 
courses are called Success/Leadership modules. 

The modules come complete with instruction manuals for the participants 
and for the coordinator, as well as overhead transparencies and so forth 
to use during the session.  The modules cost anywhere from $15 to $45, 
with proceeds going to pay for development of MORE modules.   

Modules are currently available on the following subjects:  conducting 
productive meetings, parliamentary procedure, Speechcraft (an eight-week 
public speaking education program), effective listening, effective 
evaluation, mental flexibility, the power of ideas, characteristics of 
effective leaders, developing leadership skills, training, and develop- 
ing management skills.  There is an additional course available called 
"Youth Leadership" which is similar to Speechcraft except that it's 
targeted for children and teenagers and it's not formally part of the 
Success/Leadership program. 

The modules average just over two hours each.  Modules are ordered 
through the Supply Catalog (available for a dollar from World Headquar- 
ters), but veteran members own many of them and will share them with 
newer members. 

Toastmasters International has recently published a Leadership Manual 
which contains various leadership projects.  If you wish to undertake a 
personalized development of your leadership skills, you may purchase the 
Leadership manual and get the assistance of your club in working on its 
projects.  This training in leadership takes you along the same path you 
travel on the way to a DTM and when you complete the Manual, you receive 
a certificate attesting to your leadership excellence. 

<a name="afteratm"></a>**11. What happens after I earn an ATM?**

The first thing that happens is that you send in the registration and 
receive your certificate for your achievement.  Members who earn ATM's 
are listed in Hall of Fame section of the Toastmaster magazine, and TI 
World Headquarters will send a letter to your employer if you wish 
notifying them of your accomplishment.  

After earning an ATM, you have two courses of action open to you.  One 
is to continue giving advanced manual speeches, and work towards the ATM 
Bronze and ATM Silver awards. The other is to seek leadership opportuni- 
ties and earn the DTM.  The paths are NOT mutually exclusive; members 
are encouraged to continue working down both avenues as they continue 
their membership in Toastmasters. 

<a name="bronze"></a>**12. What is an ATM Bronze and ATM Silver?**

The ATM Bronze and ATM Silver are further advances along the Able 
Toastmaster route.   

The requirements for the ATM Bronze are as follows.  You must have:

1. completed an ATM, 
2. completed three ADDITIONAL advanced manuals,  
3. given five speeches, seminars, or workshops to non-Toastmasters 
audiences in the previous two years,  
4. coordinated two additional Success/Leadership modules.  

As with the ATM, you must send in the registration to receive credit, 
and again you are recognized in the Toastmaster, and may have a letter 
sent to your employer.   

The requirements for the ATM Silver are as follows.  You must have:  

1. completed the ATM Bronze,  
2. completed three more advanced manuals other than those used for 
the ATM and ATM Bronze,  
3. have conducted a training seminar in a company or in public OR 
have conducted a Toastmasters training session for Club or District 
officers within two years of application.  
4. have judged two Toastmasters speech contests above the club 
level. 
5. presented a platform-style speech to an audience of not less 
than 50 people.

As with the ATM, you must send in the registration to receive credit, 
and again you are recognized in the Toastmaster, and may have a letter 
sent to your employer.

<a name="gold"></a>**13. Is there an ATM Gold award?**

No.

<a name="DTM"></a>**14. What is a DTM?**

DTM stands for "Distinguished Toastmaster."  The DTM is the highest 
level of certification presently awarded by Toastmasters International.  
The DTM is also the hardest award to earn.  In order to qualify for a 
DTM, you must: 

1. be an ATM,  
2. have four years continuous membership as of date of application, 
3. have coordinated at least one registered Speechcraft program 
within two years of application,  
4. have coordinated at least one registered Youth Leadership 
program within two years of application,  
5. have presented to other than a Toastmasters audience at least 
five speeches,  
6. have served a complete term as an elected club officer,  
7. have served a complete term as a District officer (e.g. District 
Governor, any District Lieutenant Governor, Division Governor, Area 
Governor, Secretary, Treasurer, or Public Relations Officer),  
8. have served as official sponsor or mentor of a new club within 
four years of application (note, up to four members may so qualify 
for each new club) OR have served as Club Specialist (appointed by 
the District Governor) in rebuilding an existing club with 9 
members or less to a total of at least 20 members within four years 
of application.  
9. have sponsored five new members within one year of application.  
These may not be charter members of a new club sponsored or 
mentored by the applicant.  To receive credit your name must appear 
as the sponsoring member on the new members' membership application 
forms.

<a name="afterdtm"></a>**15. What happens after I've earned a DTM and an ATM Silver?**

You have several options.  You may go back at any point after earning a 
CTM and work your way through the C&L manual again and earn another CTM.  
Some members earn a new CTM every year.  This is one way in which 
veteran members may remain polished at the fundamentals of public 
speaking.  You may also earn multiple ATM's and DTM's if you fulfill the 
requirements multiple times.  You can work on the Leadership Manual or 
on presenting Success/Leadership projects.  Given that the DTM and ATM 
Silver take a minimum of four years to complete, and often longer, one 
will not soon run out of things to work on in Toastmasters.

<a name="anyelse"></a>**16. Is there anything else?**

Well, yes.  The very, very best speakers may qualify for the Accredited 
Speaker program, a TI program to recognize those with professional 
speaking skills.  

The requirements to qualify as an Accredited Speaker are as follows.  
The applicant must:  

1. be a current member of a Toastmasters club.  
2. have given a minimum of 25 speaking engagements to non-Toastmas- 
ters audiences within three years of application date.  Copies of 
five letters of acknowledgement or appreciation from any of the 25 
engagements must be provided as documentary evidence of successful 
presentations.  
3. pass a rigorous two-stage judging process.

Fewer than 25% of the members who apply for the Accredited Speaker 
program become Accredited Speakers, and very few Toastmasters apply in 
the first place.  This program is only for the best.

<a name="speechbank"></a>**17.  Have you considered making a "speech bank" of good speeches presented 
by Toastmasters members available for gopher or FTP?**

Yes, this has been considered.  Some people think it would be an  
excellent idea, as they feel that there is no better way to learn 
how to write a good speech than to study others' speeches at length. 
Others, however, feel that a speech bank would lend itself more to 
Toastmasters and non-Toastmasters alike using speeches without  
attribution in speaking assignments or in speech classes, and that's 
not something we want to encourage.  Toastmasters is a learn-by-doing 
type of environment, not a "copycat, adhere to this form or that form 
that someone, somewhere called 'good'" environment.  Furthermore, 
a written copy of a speech contains none of the presentation and style 
the speaker put into its delivery and, as such, cannot be considered 
a full speech.  To appreciate a speech and learn from it, you must  
see it presented.  Hence, as yet, no "speech bank" has been set up.

## Leadership and Organization

<a name="leadops"></a>**1. What leadership opportunities within the club are open to me as a member of 
Toastmasters?**

All clubs have a staff of club officers.  These are elected 
once or twice a year, depending on whether the club meets 
weekly or every other week (or monthly, etc.).  Clubs that 
meet weekly usually elect for six month terms.  Elections 
usually take place in May for the term July 1 to June 30 and, 
where applicable, in May for the term July 1 to December 30 
and in November for the term January 1 to June 30.

Club offices (and their rank within the club) are as follows:

- President - chairs meetings and supervises all other 
officers 
- Vice President Education - schedules meeting assign- 
ments and works with members to see that their 
needs are met 
- Vice President Membership - runs club membership drive 
and also works to keep members satisfied and happy 
- Vice President Public Relations - makes sure club 
meeting listings appear in the media, puts posters 
up, etc. 
- Secretary - sends correspondence on behalf of the 
club, keeps club records and minutes 
- Treasurer - handles financial affairs, such as dues 
and purchases 
- Sergeant of Arms - sets meeting room up, puts stuff 
away, greets guests, etc.

Club offices are open to ANY member.  There is no reason why 
a new member cannot run for President without serving in any 
other club office.  

<a name="leadoutside"></a>**2. What leadership opportunities are open to me OUTSIDE the club?**

You can serve as Area Governor, Division Governor, District 
Secretary, District Treasurer, District Public Relations 
Officer, District Lieutenant Governor Marketing, District 
Lieutenant Governor Education and Training, District Governor, 
International Director, International Vice-President, or 
International President.  To explain what all these mean, you 
need to know more about each level.

<a name="area"></a>**3. What is an Area?**

Clubs are grouped into Areas of three to eight Clubs.  Each 
Area has its own Area Governor, a member of one of the clubs 
appointed by the District Governor to serve the Area.  Area 
Governors are usually, but not always, members of a club in  
the Area they are responsible for.

Areas have Area Speech Contests several times a year, with 
winners from the Club levels going on to the Area Contest.  
The winner of the Area Contest goes on to the Division.  

Areas also share Area goals, determined by formulas set at 
World Headquarters, such as "x number of clubs at 20 members 
in strength" and "x number of CTM's in the various clubs."  If 
an Area meets or exceeds all its goals, its Area Governor is 
recognized for hard work motivating the clubs.

<a name="division"></a>**4. What is a Division?**

Areas are grouped into Divisions.  Divisions may be as small 
as one Area in size (rarely) or as have five, six, or more 
Areas.  Each Division has its own Division Governor.  Division 
Governors are usually members of clubs within their Division and 
are elected once a year at the Annual District Business 
Meeting.  The Division Governor works with his Area 
Governors to motivate the clubs to high membership and to have 
good, effective educational programs.

Divisions have Division Speech Contests several times a year, 
with winners from the Areas coming together to compete.  The 
Division winners go on to the District level.

Divisions have Division goals, just as Areas do.  A good 
Division Governor will work with his clubs and Areas to 
increase membership and educational effort.

<a name="district"></a>**5. What is a District?**

Districts in some cases are equivalent to "states" and in 
other cases are smaller or larger.  If you think of a District 
as "the state organization" you won't be too far off.  
Districts are comprised of several Divisions.  Districts are 
the main level of organization outside the Club; Areas and 
Divisions are *sub-units* of the District.

California has several Districts because there are so many 
clubs there.  North Carolina, on the other hand, is a single 
District.  England and Scotland and Ireland are one District 
all together, and Australia and New Zealand comprise several 
Districts.  Smaller countries with only a few clubs each are 
Unincorporated clubs which report directly to World Headquar- 
ters instead of to Districts.

Each District has its own set of officers, most of whom are 
elected at the District Spring Conference (or Fall Conference 
in the Southern Hemisphere).  The officers include: District 
Secretary, District Treasurer, District Public Relations 
Officer, District Lieutenant Governor Marketing, District 
Lieutenant Governor Education and Training, and District 
Governor.  The last three are always elected and the first 
three are elected or appointed depending on local preference.  
If they are appointed in your District, it's the newly elected 
District Governor who does the appointing.

And yes, Districts have their own District-wide goals.  The 
various District officers work with the clubs, Areas, and 
Divisions to build membership, start new clubs, promote the 
earning of CTM's and ATM's, and so forth.

Districts have speech contests several times a year, as the 
Division winners come together at the District Conferences to 
compete for the District crowns.

<a name="complicated"></a>**6. Whoa!  That sounds complicated!**

It is, but that's the price you pay for:

- having enough offices to fill that a lot of people get 
the opportunity to serve, and 
- having enough officers on the spot to help out clubs 
that have problems (e.g. low membership).

Let's look at a made-up example to illustrate the organization:

Joe belongs to the Wide Valley Toastmasters Club (club 19521).  
The Wide Valley Toastmasters club belongs to Area 4, Central 
Division, District 95.  Area 4 is the city of Wide Valley with 
four clubs.  The Central Division is Areas 4, 5, and 6, 
comprising the mid-state area.  District 95 is the eastern 
half of the state.  Area 4 has an Area Governor who works with 
the Wide Valley club and the other three clubs in the Area.  
The Central Division has a Division Governor who works with 
all 12 clubs in his Division and with the three Area Governors 
under her.  District 95 has five Divisions and its own set of 
officers.  Joe goes to various speech contests in his Area, 
Division, and District and once a year represents his club at 
the Spring Conference to elect new officers and vote on other 
District policy matters.

<a name="distoff"></a>**7.  How do I get to be a District officer?**

If you want to be an Area Governor, show up at a lot of events 
outside your club and get to know the people around your 
District.  Work hard within your club.  Eventually, you'll be 
considered for appointment as an Area Governor.  It doesn't 
hurt to ask the people who are running for District Governor 
to consider appointing you.  If you want to be a Division 
Governor or other District Officer, you've usually got to run 
for the office.  Each club in a District gets two votes and 
the clubs that have representatives at the Spring Conference 
vote and decide who'll serve for the next year.  Terms always 
run July 1 to June 30, by the way, so elections are usually 
held in April or May.

Another good way to get to be a District officer is to 
volunteer to help a District committee.  You don't get DTM 
credit for helping a committee or serving as a District 
committee chair, but you get *known* and that's usually all it 
takes to get asked to serve the next time around.

<a name="beyonddist"></a>**8. What levels are beyond the District?**

Technically, none -- just Toastmasters International.  The 
Districts *do* get together for *Regional* Conferences in June 
of each year, but the Regions are not formally constituted 
bodies.  They're just groupings of eight or so Districts.  
Each Region is entitled to representation on the Board of 
Directors of Toastmasters International in the form of two 
International Directors who serve two-year terms, with one 
being elected each year, but it is the world body that elects 
these officers, not the Regions themselves.  The main require- 
ment for representing a Region is that you have residency and 
membership in a club in that Region.  Once you are elected, 
however, you serve the world, not just the clubs of your 
Region.

At the Regional Conferences, you also find speech contests, 
with the various District winners squaring off.  Only one 
contestant goes on to the World level; the humorous speaking 
and evaluation contests stop at the Regional level, leaving 
the International Speech Contest contestants to decide the 
World Championship of Public Speaking each August at the World 
Convention.

Regions do not have regional goals.  They're not organized 
bodies.

<a name="worldcon"></a>**9. What's the World Convention?**

The World Convention takes place each August in a North 
American city.  The main feature of the Conference, other that 
presentation of awards for effort during the preceding year, 
is the Annual Business Meeting, at which International 
officers are elected and policies are made and changed.

The clubs have the voting strength at the world level, with 
two votes each.  Districts often wind up voting the proxies 
for clubs which don't make it to the Annual Business Meeting 
each August.  

There are a dozen elections to be held each August: eight (or 
nine, if it's the year to elect the director from Overseas) 
International Directors, three Vice Presidents, and one 
President.  As there are eight Regions (with two Directors 
each) and one amalgamated Overseas area (with one Director) 
sending Directors to the world board, necessarily there are 
seventeen Directors, serving two-year terms each.  There is an 
International President and three International Vice-Presi- 
dents who serve over the whole kit and kaboodle.  They serve 
one year each.  

<a name="board"></a>**10. So the Board of Directors and the President and Vice Presidents make 
all the decisions about dues and so forth?**

Yes and no.  Any proposals they wish to see adopted that 
constitute actual changes to the constitution and bylaws of 
the organization require a vote by the assembled clubs, with 
each club having two votes.  As above, the District officers 
gather proxies from any clubs that aren't going to be at the 
annual business meeting in August.

<a name="getserve"></a>**11. What do I get for serving as an officer?**

If you serve as a club officer, you earn credit toward an ATM.  
If you serve as a District officer, you earn credit toward a 
DTM.  Service on the International level doesn't earn you 
anything in particular because you've usually already earned 
everything there is to earn by that point.  

But, more importantly, you get tremendous leadership experi- 
ence.  With everyone a volunteer and no club HAVING to do what 
its District officers suggest, you have to develop powerful 
persuasive abilities to guide the clubs and members in the 
right direction.

## Toastmasters International Speech Contests

<a name="whatcont"></a>**1.  What's all this about speech contests?**

In order to provide for people who enjoy competitive speaking, 
and in order to showcase the best, Toastmasters clubs hold 
speech contests as many as five times a year.  Each contest 
starts at the club level and works its way up through Area and 
Division to the District.  Three contests go on to Regional 
and one goes on to the World Convention each August.

The contests are:

- **Tall Tales** - 3 to 5 minutes in length.  A tall tale, which 
must be original (you can't use someone else's material).  
Goes as far as the District level in most Districts.

- **Table Topics** - 1 to 2 minutes in length.  Impromptu speaking.  
All contestants are taken out of the room and brought 
back in one by one to speak on the *same* topic, which should 
be general in nature and not require specialized knowledge 
which some contestants might have while others might not.  
Since no contestant hears the topic before his turn to speak 
on it, you can judge their impromptu speaking abilities by the 
way in which each person's effort stacks up against the 
others.  Goes as far as the District level in most Districts.

- **Evaluation** - 2 to 3 minutes in length.  A target speaker 
gives a speech which all the evaluation contestants are to 
evaluate.  The contestants are taken from the room and given 
five minutes to prepare their speeches and make notes.  Then, 
their notes are taken away and they are brought back into the 
room one by one (at which time the contestant gets his notes 
back) to deliver their oral evaluation of the target speech.  
Since no contestant hears what another said about the target 
speech, the judges can compare the analytical abilities of the 
contestants.  Goes as far as the Regional level in Regions 8; 
the other Regions do not have it.

- **Humorous speech** - 5 to 7 minutes.  Humorous speaking, which 
must be original.  Year after year, people hear the rules read 
to them and then stand up and present Bill Cosby routines and 
then act puzzled when they're disqualified.  It's supposed to 
be a *speech*, not a monologue, and it MUST be original.  It 
should also be "clean."  So-called "blue humor" will get you 
zero points in the "appropriateness" column of the judges' 
forms.  In other words, it should be a five-to-seven minute 
speech with a lot of humor value, but ALSO displaying good 
speechmaking abilities.  Goes as far as the Regional level in 
most Regions.

- **International Speech** - 5 to 7 minutes.  Any topic at all, so 
long as it's original.  Can be funny, serious, whatever.  It 
should be the best speech you can give, and it must be 
original.  Did I mention that it must be original?  Don't do 
what so many speakers do and crib at length from someone 
else's works and then expect that no one in the audience will 
smell a rat.  The reason this contest is called "International 
Speech" instead of "General Speech" or "Miscellaneous Speech" 
is because it's the only one of the five contests that goes as 
far as the World level.  Each August, winners from the eight 
Regions and the Overseas clubs (9 contestants in all) compete 
at the World Convention in the World Championship of Public 
Speaking.

<a name="pickwin"></a>**2.  How do you pick the winners?**

Each contest has a set of rules which mandate originality and 
lay down the procedures.  If you go over your time limit by 
thirty seconds, you're eliminated.  If you go UNDER your time 
limit by thirty seconds, you're eliminated -- except in Table 
Topics, where you must speak at least one minute, no less.  
Out in the audience, there'll be a set of judges, scattered 
among the audience, each with a points form that they use to 
rate you against what a winning effort should be and how you 
stack up against the others.  There's a different form for 
each contest, since each contest involves different skills.

<a name="whocomp"></a>**3. Who gets to compete?**

Any member in good standing (i.e. you've got your dues paid) 
can compete when the contests come around -- except for 
current District and International officers and candidates for 
same -- except for the International Speech Contest.  To 
compete in the International Speech Contest, you must have 
given at least six manual speeches towards your CTM.  This 
requirement is intended to prevent professional speakers from 
joining Toastmasters out of the blue solely to compete toward 
the World Championship of Public Speaking.  District and 
International officers are barred so the judges won't be 
swayed by their titles.

<a name="whencont"></a>**4. When do the contests take place?**

It varies from District to District.  Some Districts have two 
contests in the fall, one in the winter, and two in the 
spring.  Others have two in the fall, two in the winter, and 
one in the spring.  All that matters as far as Toastmasters 
International is concerned is that all Districts must have 
held their Evaluation, Humorous, and International Speech 
contests by the time the Regional conferences roll around in 
June.

<a name="getwin"></a>**5. What do I get if I win a contest?**

At the club level, sometimes all you get is a handshake and 
some applause.  By the time you've gotten up to Division and 
District levels, you're getting some fairly impressive 
trophies. 

<a name="distrule"></a>**6. My District has different rules for the various speech contests. 
Is this permitted?**

This situation came up recently in District 37 (North Carolina). 
A club was told that the official District rules for the Humorous 
Speech Contest mandated similar eligibility requirements for the 
Humorous contest as for the International Speech contest, to wit, 
all contestants had to have been members on or before July 1 of the 
current year, and had to have given at least four (I.S. requires six) 
manual speeches.  According to the District officers involved,  
these were the official rules for all Humorous Speech contests held 
in North Carolina, and even though the official rules mailed to 
all clubs by Toastmasters International mandated that the only  
eligibility requirement be membership in good standing in a club 
in good standing, the District 37 rules applied nonetheless.

The club President in question checked with TI WHQ and was told 
in no uncertain terms that any District which holds speech contests 
must use the official Toastmasters International rules and that  
Districts are not permitted to change the rules as published by 
Toastmasters International in any way.

This policy of course doesn't apply to contests the District has 
invented on its own, but for the Big 5 (International, Humorous, 
Table Topics, Tall Tales, and Evaluation), if your District has 
changed the time limits, eligibility requirements, or policy 
regarding originality (one District supposedly waived the origi- 
nality requirement for the Tall Tales contest), they're in the 
wrong.  If they don't believe this to be the case, ask them to 
contact Toastmasters International World Headquarters themselves. 
They'll be swiftly corrected.

Why is this important, by the way?  Simple: the only official 
rules most clubs get for the contests are the ones TI themselves 
mail out.  It would be tremendously discouraging to be belatedly 
told that the rules your club had used for the contest you won 
were not the official rules as practiced in YOUR District, and 
thus, you can't compete at the next level.  In many cases, 'Offi- 
cial District Rules' are known only by those who have a dog-eared 
photocopy that's five years old (as was the case in District 37). 
That's wrong.  If your District has changed the rules, tell them  
they can't, and if they say "Sure we can," let TI World HQ know.

Contests are fun, but it's important to run them the same way 
everywhere around the world.  Fairness and a level playing field 
aren't just luxuries.  They're required.

Contest or some other contest you didn't mention?**

Districts can hold whatever contests they want in addition to 
the five sanctioned International contests listed above.  However, 
these vary from District to District and it would not be possible 
to list all the various speech contests held throughout the world 
of Toastmasters here in this FAQ.
