# Guest Information for Goddard Toastmasters

*Last updated: December 4, 2025*

## Visiting Goddard Toastmasters {#visiting-goddard-toastmasters}

### Welcome to Our Club

We are delighted to have you as a guest at our meeting today. You are joining with a group of people who are dedicated to the goal of more effective communication through effective speaking, careful listening, and critical thinking. We get together regularly to practice new communication skills and polish already established skills. We're serious about our goal but believe the best way to get there is to learn by doing and to enjoy ourselves along the way.

### Meeting Information

**Meeting Schedule:** We meet on the **2nd and 4th Wednesdays** of each month.

**Time:** **11:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time**

**Location:** Meetings are held **virtually**. See our [main page](/clubs/toastmasters/) for current meeting connection details.

We occasionally hold **blended meetings** that are both virtual and on-site. Please check **Dateline Goddard** (internal to GSFC employees) for the current location, or contact our [VP Education or VP Membership](/clubs/toastmasters/#club-officers) for details.

**Guests:** Guests are always welcome!

### What Happens at Our Meetings

To give you a brief overview, there are four main parts to our meeting:

1. **Business Session** - The meeting begins with a business session during which the business of the club is transacted. This section helps us focus on leadership skills and meeting management.

2. **Prepared Speaking** - Second on the program is prepared speaking. Members develop their speaking ability and self-confidence as they progress through Pathways projects, typically 5 to 7 minute speeches, each of which focuses on specific communication skills.

3. **Table Topics** - The third part of the meeting is Table Topics during which we practice impromptu speaking. Since most of our everyday communications are informal rather than prepared (consider meetings or telephone conversations), Table Topics provides an important opportunity to improve our ability to think on our feet, organize our thoughts, and express ourselves clearly and concisely.

4. **Evaluation** - The program concludes with evaluation. This is an important part of our meeting because it affords the speakers a chance to receive constructive feedback and other members a chance to practice giving immediate, helpful feedback in a friendly, supportive atmosphere.

### During the Meeting We Invite You To:

- **APPLAUD** after the introduction of a speaker and at the conclusion of each speech
- **PARTICIPATE** in Table Topics (let one of the members know before the meeting starts if you'd like to participate)
- **VOTE** along with members and other guests for Best Speaker, Best Evaluator, and Best Table Topics Respondent (you will be given ballots at the beginning of the meeting)
- **TELL** us your reaction to the meeting at its conclusion (but don't feel obligated to do so). Maybe you would rather speak to one of the members afterward.

We hope you enjoy today's meeting, and that we will see you again.
