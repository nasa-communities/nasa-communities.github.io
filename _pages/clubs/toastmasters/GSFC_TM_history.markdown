# A Brief History of Goddard Toastmasters

The year 2007 marked the 35th birthday of the Goddard Toastmasters. 
Our official charter date is January 17, 1972 during the term of 
Toastmasters International President Russell G. Herron. As with any new 
Toastmasters Club, the drive for a club at Goddard began with a small 
group of Goddard people seriously interested in the educational and 
communication opportunities offered by the Toastmasters International 
organization. A new group reaches charter status only through the hard 
work of its organizers who come from the potential new club and from 
the membership of an established Toastmasters Club. For Goddard the 
assistance came from nearby Agricultural Research Center (ARC) 
Toastmasters. Gary Heinz of ARC was our club's sponsor; he ran the 
first few meetings, came as a guest almost every meeting while 
organizing, and oversaw the first Goddard elections. Goddard 
Toastmasters officially came into existence in 1972 under Area Governor 
Sam Carney of the USDA.

Early on Goddard management recognized Toastmasters as an important 
training activity. At first this support was in the form of meeting 
space and equipment. In May, 1974 William Hocking, who then was the 
President of Goddard Toastmasters, began the process of having 
Toastmasters recognized as an official training activity at Goddard. 
The 1975 President, Doris Anne Martin, continued this process which 
ended successfully that summer in recognition for the Fiscal Year of 
1976.

Until 1992 our club year was the calendar year, so the officers served 
January 1 to December 31. In 1992 Toastmasters International changed 
the club year to the current July 1 to June 30.
