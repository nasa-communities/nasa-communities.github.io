<h1>About</h1>

<p class="lead">Welcome to NASA Communities.</p>

Supported through the [NASA Exchanges](https://www.nasa.gov/exchange/), we seek to cultivate a vibrant community by facilitating activities and services that engage, enrich and energize the NASA Family.

Check out the activities, groups, employee organizations and clubs that provide services, morale, welfare, and recreation activities to NASA employees and our extended NASA family.

We're a small team of volunteers that manage this site. If you'd like to get involved, come check out [our spot on GitHub](https://github.com/nasa-communities).
