The **Goddard Chinese American Club (GCAC)** was founded in 1987. The primary objective of the club is to promote and provide professional, social, and cultural activities among the club members and in the GSFC community. 

The club organizes Goddard-wide luncheons three times a year: in Jan-Feb for the Chinese New Year Celebration, in May for the Asian Pacific American Heritage Month celebration, and in September for the Mid-Autumn Moon Festival Celebration. We have a feature presentation regarding Chinese American Culture at every luncheon. Past luncheon speakers and performers include former Secretary Norman Mineta, former Ambassador Julia Chang Bloch, TV cook Martin Yan, the Alice Gu Zheng Ensemble, Tai Chi Instructor Dr. Jianping Mao, and Radio Talk Show host Dr. Tom Roselle. 

The main function of the club is to share Chinese culture at Goddard in terms of gourmet, language learning, and healthy exercises such as Qigong and Tai Chi. Meanwhile, there is also a social aspect to the club among the active club members. There are more than 300 club members. If you are interested in joining in the club or if you have any questions, you may contact the [club president](#officials).
