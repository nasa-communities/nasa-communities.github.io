Come play Ultimate Frisbee, Tuesday and Thursday on the Goddard main lawn! We typically meet under the large tree next to building 1 and start warming up around 5:30, then play until 7:15. Our season goes from roughly April to the start of day light savings.

All skill levels are welcome and encouraged to play, we love to teach beginners! Come meet us or contact Alan to get on the nag email list!

Bring water, gym clothes, running shoes or cleats, and a positive attitude!
