Come play Ultimate Frisbee, Tuesday and Thursday on the Goddard main lawn! We typically start warming up around 5:30 and play until 7:15. We meet under the large tree next to building 1. Our season goes from roughly April to the start of day light savings. All skill levels are welcome and encouraged to play, we love to teach beginners!

Come meet us or contact Alan to get on the nag email list!

Bring water, gym clothes, running shoes or cleats, and a positive attitude!
