Our season typically starts in late September and goes until play offs in May. Games are on Friday nights and we are based out of the Greenbelt community center.

**Address:** 15 Crescent Rd, Greenbelt, MD 20770

We also host occasional open gyms and, during the off-season, we play outdoors in the GSFC quad area. Please contact us for more information!
