| 10   | Meeting     | **Unleash your creativity (Lori Lankford)**   | **TBD**                   | Lori Lankford brings a refreshing approach to photography, making it fun, simple, and creative. She has a passion for teaching and mentoring photographers at all levels to develop their unique style and vision. Her personal English garden, transformed from bare dirt into a thriving floral paradise over the past three years, serves as both a creative workspace and a source of inspiration for her photography.

This technique uses predominantly white or light tones throughout the composition, creating an image that appears bright, airy, and often optimistic or uplifting.
